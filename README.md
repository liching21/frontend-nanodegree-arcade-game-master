Frogger - Udacity Front End Nano Degree Project 3
===============================

Skeleton code provided by Udacity, further updated by Liching Yew

---------------------------------------------

To play the game please visit the following website:

http://liching21.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game-master/

Upon reaching the site, you will be prompt to select a hero by entering a numeric value ranging from 1 to 5.

The aim of the game is for you to navigate your selected hero to the river without colliding with the bugs.

To navigate your selected character use arrow keys up, down, left and right.

You have 3 lives. Each time the hero collides with a bug, you lose a life.

Losing all 3 lives will end the game.

So be sure to avoid the bugs!

Successfully reaching the river will earn you one point, and colliding with a bug will cause you to lose a point.

Happy Playing! :D
